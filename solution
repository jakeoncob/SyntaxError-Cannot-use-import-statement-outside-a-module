if you get the SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
what fixed it for me was to add "type": "module", inside of package.json

This is actually likely to cause the error:

ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and 
'/Users/jakecoble/Desktop/BaseForGPT/package.json' contains "type": "module".
To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.

But to fix this you can simply add:

import { createRequire } from 'module';
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

Into your code and now you can do things such as:

const express = require("express")
